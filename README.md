This mod is licensed under GPL-3. This mod may of course be forked and continued. If uploaded to Nexus, out of respect towards my creative & time investment I kindly ask that you point 75% of the DP it earns to my Nexus account (Sairion350). However there is one catch in that I have embarrasingly lost the list of where I sourced the sound effects from, so you may need to get new sfx. I will push a txt file with credits if I find it again.
